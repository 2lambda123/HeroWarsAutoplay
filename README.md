Scripts for auto-playing portions of Hero Wars

Hello and welcome! I've been playing around with some python scripts so that my computer can grind through Hero Wars while I make my coffee. I've been using them for the past year to race through the tower, and dungeon portions without my involvement.




Donations:

I do have a full-time job that pays reasonably well, but my ex-wife left and tried to take our toddler son (and cash along the way). I made sure she failed, but I don't have much free time or cash now from the legal battle, so if you like these scripts, please feel free to donate! Thank you again for your support.
