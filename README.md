Scripts for auto-playing portions of Hero Wars

Hello and welcome! I've been playing around with some python scripts so that my computer can grind through Hero Wars while I make my coffee. I've been using them for the past year to race through the tower, and dungeon portions without my involvement.

If you have questions, feel free to post it in the issues tab. If you want to see an improvement, mark your post an enhancement. 



Donations:

I do have a full-time job, but my ex-wife left and tried to take our toddler son too. I made sure she failed, but I don't have much free time or cash now from the legal battle, so if you like these scripts, please feel free to donate! Thank you again for your support.
