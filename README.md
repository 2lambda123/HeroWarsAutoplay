# Hero Wars Autoplay Script
Scripts that let the computer grind through portions of Hero Wars. 

Hello and welcome! I've been playing around with some python scripts so that my computer can grind through Hero Wars while I make my coffee. I've been using them for the past two years to race through the tower, and dungeon portions without my involvement. This script works by controlling the mouse on your computer, and can be disrupted by ads or slow internet, so make sure to turn off pop-ups and make sure you set the load time (see [Installation Instructions]github.com/TheCryOfSamMcGee/HeroWarsAutoplay/blob/main/Installation.md) ). I haven't tested this on other computers, so use it at your own risk. The worst that can happen is that it goes off course and clicks on things on your screen. Move the mouse around, and the script will pause. That was a problem in early development, and at this point, I haven't had that happen in the last year and a half. 

<br /> Lastly, if you have a Mac, I don't have a script for you, sorry. Theoretically, if I had a Mac, it would be easy to create the same script for Apple computers, but I can't afford one.

## Running the script

The script is designed to navigate Hero Wars from the full screen view. From the main page of Hero Wars, look at the bottom right corner and you'll see two green buttons. The left one will make Hero Wars run full screen. From there, the script will figure everything else out. Just follow the prompts. 

Just make sure to run the script starting from the Hero Wars home page opened to the full screen view.

## Installation
If you want to install and run this script, you need to install python with all the libraries. See the [Installation page](https://github.com/TheCryOfSamMcGee/HeroWarsAutoplay/blob/main/Installation.md) for instructions.

## Current limitations:
- Right now, the script is designed for people who are level 130, and doesn't work if you can't skip the battles in the tower. 
- It only runs on Windows, because I do not have a Mac to play around with, and I cannot afford one.
- There isn't a way to update the load

If you have questions, feel free to post it in the issues tab. If you want to see an improvement, you can post something on the issue tab, and mark it as an enhancement.

Additional considerations: If you have pop-ups or other unusual stuff screen-wise, it may click on those and exit Hero Wars, so use it at your own risk. If you want the script to stop quickly, just move your mouse - it'll detect that and pause. This script is meant to be used at your own risk, so be smart. If you are worried about it accidentally spending diamonds, then monitor it. I've added a setting to account for slower internet (see installation instructions), and if your internet is too slow, the script can mess up and spend diamonds accidentally.

The only time I've seen the script get confused is when the loading screen for the tower took too long. The script thought it was moving through the tower during the loading screen, and accidentally exit the tower as a result. However, the mouse still moved to the positions to open chests within the tower, meaning that when it went to click on the next chest in the tower, it would click on the hero's chest and spend diamonds to open it. So yeah, adjust the loading time, and you won't have that problem.

## Donations:

I do have a full-time job, but my ex-wife left me and tried to take full custody of our son. I made sure she failed, but I'm strapped for time and cash, so if you like these scripts, please feel free to donate! If no one donates, I'll probably stop developing this, and focus on other side projects instead.
